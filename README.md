## About CDash

CDash is an open source, web-based software testing server. CDash aggregates, analyzes and displays the results of
software testing processes submitted from clients located around the world. Developers depend on CDash to convey the
state of a software system, and to continually improve its quality. CDash is a part of a larger software process that
integrates Kitwareâ€™s CMake, CTest, and CPack tools, as well as other external packages used to design, manage and
maintain large-scale software systems. Good examples of a CDash are the
[CMake quality dashboard](https://open.cdash.org/index.php?project=CMake) and the
[VTK quality dashboard](https://open.cdash.org/index.php?project=VTK).
